# Crop-Disease-Detection
FARM-AID is an AI-powered crop disease detection system built to support farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat by enabling early identification of diseases in key crops like wheat, rice, maize, sugarcane, potato, and cotton. Using deep learning models, the system analyzes images of crops to deliver accurate and real-time disease diagnoses.

The project integrates:

A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for efficiency and accuracy

Pre-trained models like ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0, fine-tuned for agricultural image classification

Advanced data augmentation techniques to overcome class imbalance and enhance generalization

A diverse dataset of over 13,000 images covering both healthy and diseased crops

FARM-AID achieves over 96% classification accuracy, offering a scalable and field-ready solution that empowers farmers with actionable insights, improving crop yield and agricultural sustainability.
